## Why

I want to learn too many things, but time is limited.
I struggle to allocate time to study, because life happens: job, cooking, social life...
I want to learn new things to grow as a person.
I want to learn new things to grow professionally.

## Context

My learning goals vary from time to time.

Sometimes my learning goals are driven by events. When I came back from my trip around Germany and Croatia in Sep-Oct 2019, I was very motivated to learn French, German, swing dancing and salsa dancing.

Other times my learning goals are driven by needs. After the trip, I started a new job in London (software) which reminded me of my computer science knowledge gaps due to my career change - my academical background is not software. I wanted to learn algorithms, new technologies, the ins-and-outs of programming languages, etc.

Another thing to consider is my throughput. Learning is easier if your job doesn't require all your cognitive capacity, or if you don't have to daily fight with your landlord. There will be times when you simply don't have more energy, time or motivation to learn. It is specially in these moments when being flexible and disciplined is key: flexible to avoid burning out, and disciplined to be consistent and leverage long-term routines for learning.

The chosen learning solution must consider the following points:

  - Learning volume flexibility: reducing or increasing the content learned as needed.
  - Not much hassle: there is not much overhead to learn in my spare times, such as commuting to work, waiting for a plane, waiting to meet a person, etc.
  - Keep material safe: creating content and parking it for a few months is fine, I can pick it up anytime without re-creating the learning content.
  - Different topics: I must be able to focus on specific contents when needed (job interview).
